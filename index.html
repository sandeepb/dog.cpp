Your assignment is to learn how to use the Dog class (<a href="Dog.cpp">Dog.cpp</a>, <a href="Dog.h">Dog.h</a>).<br><br>

<b>Assignment:</b> Write a main() function, in a file called Lab3.cpp, that uses the Dog class in the following ways:
<ul>
 <li>Create at least two different dogs</li>
 <li>Give the dogs to people</li>
 <li>Abuse and pat the dogs several different times</li>
 <li>Talk to the dogs</li>
</ul>

As you go through these actions, use the appropriate accessors to show information about the dog as it changes. You should not have to modify the Dog class.

<br><br><b>Compiling:</b>  To compile your assignment, use the following commands:
<ol>
 <li><code>g++ -ansi -Wall -c Dog.cpp</code></li>
 <li><code>g++ -ansi -Wall -c Lab3.cpp</code></li>
 <li><code>g++ -ansi -Wall -o Lab3 Dog.o Lab3.o</code></li>
</ol>


<b>Sample Output:</b><br>
Here is a sample output. Note that the assignment directions require you to do more than this.<br>

<code>Creating dogs...<br>
Dog1's name is: grep<br>
Dog2's name is: Dr. Pepper<br>
Dog1's age is 32 years<br>
Setting Dog2's owner to Red Bull<br>
Dog2's owner is Red Bull<br>
Abusing Dog2...<br>

Dog2 is sad<br>
Dog1 says woof<br></code>
<br>
<b>Extra Credit (4 points):</b><br>
<ol>
 <li>Create a vector of dogs</li>
 <li>Push back at least 5 different dogs with varying ages</li>
 <li>Print out each dog's name along with its age</li>
 <li>Sort the vector of dogs by age</li>
 <li>Print out each dog's name along with its age</li>
</ol>
